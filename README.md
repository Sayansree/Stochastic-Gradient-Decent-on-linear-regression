# Stochastic-Gradient-Decent-on-linear-regression
Using simple gradient decent on a linear regression machine learning model to train it on a simple data set containing randomly generated data of ditance travelled to calorries burned in order for the model to be able to predict the outcome for any given input.
The gradient decent is also implemented on quadratic and other polynomial curve but it is not optimum as the problem conain local minimas of error however we also demonstrate them.
